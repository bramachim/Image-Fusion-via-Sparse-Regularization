This source code package includes the MATLAB source codes for the proposed image fusion and joint problem algorithms in the thesis of ?Medical Image Fusion based on Sparse Representation and Non-Convex Regularization?.
The specific function of each main code is shown blow:
FL1: Image fusion with L1 norm regularization;
FGMC: Image fusion with GMC regularization;
FSL1: Joint image fusion and super-resolution with L1 norm regularization;
FSGMC: Joint image fusion and super-resolution with GMC regularization;
FDrealGMC: Joint image fusion and deconvolution with GMC regularization on the real OCT and fundus image data sets (PSF estimation);
